<small>(I had not previously noticed that my account number was `l33t`)</small>

A final (?) update on the de-fossil-fueling:

- &#10004; electric car
- &#10004; electric induction range
- &#10004; electric lawn equipment
- ~~&#128078; natural gas boiler for hydronic space heating~~ (recycled!)
- &#10004; electric heat pump for heating/cooling
- ~~&#128078; natural gas water heater~~ (recycled!)
- &#10004; electric water heater, with preheat from heat pump
- ~~&#128078; natural gas decorative fireplace~~ (only disconnected, decorative electric "logs" on order)
- &#129335; BBQ propane tank

All appliance lines are capped, and the main house gas supply is shut
off. woot!

Now all that remains is a couple of chimneys to plug, and finding my way
through the labyrinthine rebate websites.
