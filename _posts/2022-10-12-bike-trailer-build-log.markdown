title: Bike Trailer Build Log
---

[Previously](/2022/09/09/bike-trailer/) and
[previously](/2022/09/26/foam-sandwich/).

Since I started working on this goofy bike camper trailer idea, I've
been recording some timelapses and taking pictures of various parts.
Some were on YouTube and some in a random directory and some on private
Google Photos.

So I thought I'd make a [build log page](/trailer) with various bits
pulled together, along with running commentary if for some reason you're
morbidly curious. Or more realistically because it will be
self-entertaining for me 10 years from now.

[https://scot.tg/trailer](/trailer) will be updated (appended-to) whenever
there's new pictures.

(Yes, yes, I worked on Chrome for 9 years and I still can't make the div
padding work like I want it, or even put in the effort to make the
ding-dang CSS work reasonably on a phone or tablet. Sorry.)
