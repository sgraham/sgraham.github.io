Ranting on this story: [Grammar guide an 'education
disaster'](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/grammar-guide-is-an-education-disaster-claims-critic/story-e6frg6nf-1225832369733)

Summary: The English Teachers' Assocation of Queensland<sup>1</sup>
published an error-filled grammar guide, a Professor of Linguistics
tried to suggest corrections, disaster resulted.

It's one of those increasingly common articles where one party states
facts about a topic and another party claims an opposing viewpoint,
citing a "difference of opinion". But in reality, the story is not about
two different viewpoints, it's a case of sanity versus insanity.

There are objective truths. There are things not subject to one's
opinion.

Anyhow, that wasn't what I was irritated about before I started typing.
The concluding paragraph of the article:

> Another example is the phrase "set of", as in "a set of bowls", being
> described as an adjective, which Professor Huddleston says is not a
> grammatical unit but a noun followed by a preposition.

No! Well, yes! But what the hell is with subordinating simple facts into
a quote to appear balanced? "set of" as in "a set of bowls" *isn't* a
grammatical unit. "set" is a noun. ***It is so***. It does not require
an authority opinion from dear Professor Huddleston.

I should be more concerned about the subject of the article, but Mr.
Graham says "Meh".

...

And because this occasion happens to be a passable reason to offer this
link: [some classic Dave
Barry](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001800.html).
