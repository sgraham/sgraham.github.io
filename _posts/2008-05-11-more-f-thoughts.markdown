title: More FSharp thoughts
---

It&#8217;s pretty irritating so far, but I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s
because I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing or because I don&#8217;t have
some key insight into the language structure yet, or what. I find I&#8217;m
poking around a lot trying to figure out if I need a terminator or a keyword
in random places, and because of the structure of the language there&#8217;s
not as many opportunities as in C# for the IDE to tell you what to type next.  

There&#8217;s also the #light thing which is silly. The option should clearly
have been #dark (or whatever the opposite of #light is in this case) or a
command line option to make it compatible with whatever Caml dialect is
non-#light.

I feel like there&#8217;s things missing from Seq. and so on, but that&#8217;s
more likely that I just don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re called yet, or
I&#8217;m expressing things incorrectly I&#8217;d guess.

At the same time, it&#8217;s very pretty in a lot of ways. The interop with
.net (though I haven&#8217;t used it yet), immumtability by default,
FSI-in-VS, and multicore-niceness are obvious wins. I don&#8217;t know if
it&#8217;s applicable to games yet: there&#8217;d be an inordinate amount of
panic if extra computation was done unnecessarily of course. Anyway, I like it
enough apparently, I just got Amazon to fire me a copy of &#8220;Expert
F#&#8221;, which I hope is teh awesome.
