There's this horrible, over-produced, top 40, shit music that's piped
through the office. Thankfully it's only in the stairwells, elevator
area, bathroom, etc. and not audible from anywhere near where I sit.
Though I suspect there's some poor bastard that has the Worst Cubicle
Ever that can hear it all day.

Anyway, it's been like this since that phase of the building opened 3-4
years ago. So this isn't a new thing, it's been the same insipid music
ever since someone made the mistake of wiring in the possibility.

The last two days though, I was sitting taking a crap and realized just
*how much* it sucks and irritates me.

Taking a huge dump is one of the best times for a complicated technical
issue to crystalize, or for the cause of a particularly nasty bug to
become obvious. It's second perhaps only to the supremely productive
meditative time during a morning shower.

But no.

Instead, I'm sitting listening to Miley Cyrus or Hilary Duff or
*Someone-Who-Just-Had-a-Photo-Shoot-in-***Teen***-With-This-Month's-Hottest-Vampire!!*

I have visions of smashing a screwdriver into the metal speaker grating.
I expect it'd be very satisfying.
