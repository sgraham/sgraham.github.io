For a while I used the little Google Tasks window in Gmail, but then for some
reason I stopped.

At first I wasn't sure why I stopped using it, but then I realized that it was
because it closes itself frequently (always?), so I don't see it enough.

So, in the [vein of random
tweaks](/2009/12/09/background-open-for-reader-in-chrome), another Chrome
extension.

This one's very simple: it just sets the [Chrome New Tab page to be Tasks](
https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bokbgdhblfolpfanocjafjhpjkebhlfk).
Hopefully if I see them more often, I'll be more inclined to *do* some of 'em.
