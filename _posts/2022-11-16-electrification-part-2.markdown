title: Electrification Part 2
---

[Previously](/2022/06/07/electrification/) I described my attempt to
de-fossil fuel our house.

Progress was quite delayed by backordered equipment, a thoroughly
enjoyable 10,000 km cross-country camping road trip (in an EV, for the
record!), and summer family-and-friends time on the other coast.

Before we left on our summer trip, I had gotten the contractor lined up
for the electrical work, and they got the permit, and did the install of the
electrical work for both the heat pump and an electric water heater.
That actually got done the day before we started the long drive from
Vancouver to Ottawa.

The heat pump was backordered anyway, so I put down a deposit, and
figured it would work out well: We'd just get it installed when we
returned in August, and before it got cold.

Unfortunately, while we were gone, the City of Vancouver had been
iterating on the heat pump regulations and by July they required both a
separate heat pump permit, as well as a special course that the heat
pump technician had to take in order to be eligible to pull the permit.

This is totally understandable in isolation.

However, I chose my heat pump installer based on them being able to
retrofit gas hydronic in-floor to both heat-and-cooling, and this is
very much a not-commonly available solution. Due to the unusual style of
heat pump, I ended up with a contractor from quite a long way away, and
while they'd installed a lot of systems all over British Columbia, they
very rarely-to-never work in Vancouver proper. With the new course and
permit being City of Vancouver-only, they were also understandably not
overly excited to commute in to take a (multiple day?) course just to be
able to pull a permit for me.

So I was kind of stuck, and they had a huge heat pump sitting in their
shop waiting to be installed. I pleaded my case to the installers and
while not too thrilled about it, they tried twice to get signed up for
the course, but for reasons unclear were never able to actually get it
done.

As the weeks passed it was getting more ensaddening. Doom-scrolling one
night, I happened to notice a City of Vancouver tweet encouraging heat
pump installs, and I succumbed to the time-honoured tradition of whining
in replies on Twitter. For better-and-worse, this tactic totally worked,
and soon thereafter an [extraordinarily helpful sustainability advocate
and member of the green buildings team](https://twitter.com/CAHiggins)
with the City of Vancouver had reached out, investigated, and in short
order had found a solution to the permit problem.

Having that sorted, there was just the usual problems of negotiating
contractors to show up at the right times (gasfitter, electrician, heat
pump tech, etc.) and not having them waste time waiting for each other.

We're now almost de-fossilized, I'm hopeful by next week I'll be able to
call our gas provider to cut the natural gas line entirely. But looking
at the overall state of things, I would say it's still "kinda hard" to
get here:

1. Each house is somewhat custom. It's unfortunately not as if you just
   pop down to Home Depot and decide you want your gas/oil junk out, and
   load **The Electric Thingy** into yonder pickup truck and hook it up
   one afternoon. It would be simpler if your house is a "normal" forced
   air system with ducting rather than hydronic, but you still might not
   know exactly what you need, or what needs upgrading, or even what
   sort of contractor(s) to engage with.

2. Sort of related, but a lot of heat pump installers are somewhat
   "boutique" (i.e. 1-3 people). So they may not have all the
   skills/trades required, so you'll need to coordinate a bunch of
   contractors for gas/electrical/plumbing and then maybe others,
   especially if you're not comfortable doing small "extras" yourself
   (e.g. concrete, drywall/paint touchup, etc.) Also, in the Vancouver
   area effectively all trades are in high demand, and it can be a
   challenge to find someone who is willing and able to show up at a
   particular time, especially for a small job.

3. Supply chain, backorders, part price inflation, etc. are **very** much
   a thing.

4. Install cost is quite high. The Provincial (BC) and City (Vancouver)
   rebates to encourage switching are currently very generous here
   (assuming I actually successfully get the rebates!). But very roughly
   they get you cost-competitive with installing a "new mid-range gas
   thing".

5. Unpredictable running cost: We (as in, **Humans-of-Earth**) are clearly
   learning that energy prices of all types are likely to be
   increasingly volatile, but I found it quite difficult to accurately
   estimate how much it's really going to cost to run the system once
   it's installed (again, somewhat going back to the "all houses are
   custom" bit). I think this alone could easily be a deal-breaker for
   many people.

So overall, you definitely still have to really "want it" to get this
done at this point, and I think there's at least a mild financial
**dis**incentive to doing so. As mentioned in the previous post, I expect
running costs for heating to be higher than non-renewable natural gas by
a factor of approximately 1.5x-2x. If you squint really hard and expect
natural gas price to rise fairly substantially (without Hydro similarly
increasing), you could maybe imagine it being a win. But given the
political fallout that every gas price spike causes, I don't really
expect that.

I used to be paid too much to type code for some reason, so we're in the
unreasonably-lucky-situation of not being too sensitive to monthly
heating costs. So I wanted to do this sort of for fun (?? my next
project is probably [IoTaWatt](https://iotawatt.com/)), and sort of as a
"donation" to the common weal.

But it doesn't feel like as a city/province/country we're at the point
where an average person would be very inclined to do these retrofits.
Understandably, the emphasis is on legislation for how new construction
is heated and insulated, and some of that looks great! But it's still a
bit sad when you think about how slowly existing buildings will change
as a result.

**Anyway!**

I'm really happy with our new heat pump system all the same, and
performance is great a couple weeks in. Having mucked through that, our
status is now:

- &#10004; electric car
- &#10004; electric induction range
- &#10004; electric lawn equipment
- ~~&#128078; natural gas boiler for hydronic space heating~~ (recycled!)
- &#10004; electric heat pump for heating/cooling
- &#128078; natural gas water heater (hopefully to be deprecated this week)
- &#128078; natural gas decorative fireplace (also hopefully to be deprecated this week)
- &#129335; BBQ propane tank

I don't think I'm going to worry too much about the 20 lbs tank of
propane per year for the BBQ, at least until we work on other larger
CO&#8322;e lifestyle changes.

Also, If you're in the Greater Vancouver area I'd be happy to chat about
our electrical, heat pump, and gas contractors, or the nitty-gritty
details of the overall process if you're interested!
