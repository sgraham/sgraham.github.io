title: Engine No.1 and VOTE ETF
---

I hadn't heard about Engine No.1 until everyone else did (when they
executed on what seemed like a [clever PR
stunt](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-faces-proxy-fight-launched-by-new-activist-firm-engine-no-1-2020-12-11/)
of wrestling away a few seats [on the Exxon
board](https://reenergizexom.com/board-candidates/)).

Most of the news briefs made it sound like they'd gotten some
clean-energy-only-hippies elected to the board and that they were taking
down The Exxon Man from the inside. From reading those bios it doesn't
really seem like that at all, but maybe at least having that story out
there makes us all feel like we're heading in a better direction.

I'd previously tried a few small investments that were branded
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), but the idea of my tiny
amount of investment money making much difference by divesting didn't
seem compelling. I'm not sure whether investing in Engine No.1's [VOTE
ETF](https://etf.engine1.com/) will actually be effective or not either,
but I at least like the general idea of using activist hedge fund
tactics to effect some sort of environmental change.

If you have other ideas about productive climate investments to make,
LMK.
