I thought I liked jQuery, but it&#8217;s just a bit too weird after using it
for a bit. I kept having the feeling that it was too much magic and not enough
JavaScript. So, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://mootools.net/">mootools</a>
now. It&#8217;s very similar, but one or both of the design and documentation
is better, and as a result I&#8217;m much happier with it.
