I've tried Wordpress, Blogger, and Tumblr (most recently), but they're a sack
of ass. The text editors are horrible and butcher the posts, and it's just
about damn impossible to paste/type code into a post and expect it to turn out
reasonable. I thought I could trade the asseyness of them for the less hassle
that a hosted service should offer, but apparently I can't.

So, I sucked it up and configured [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It's pretty
manual to set up, but it's just a static site generator from a
simpler-than-html-language (markdown et al.) and spits out some stuff.

I went "fancy" (OK, not really) and used
[Cuf&oacute;n](http://cufon.shoqolate.com/) on the headings too. It's a pretty
neat JS library+tool. It renders a font to VML + another format as data for a
JS script, so then can incrementally replace text with your custom one, either
by using VML on IE, or by using &lt;canvas> on all other browsers. Et voila,
*The New Yorker*-ish heading font.

Anyway, it's *easier* to post now, and I can edit in Vim, but I probably won't
still, because, well, 140 characters about lunch is a lot less work than
writing thoughtful essays.
