title: Electrification

As part of getting my literal house [in order](/2021/08/13/unemployed/)
I've wanted to de-fossil fuel our house. When we moved in a couple years
ago, our electrification vs. fossil fuel status was pretty common for
our area:

<!-- 10004 is heavy check, 128078 is thumbs-down -->

- &#10004; electric induction range
- &#10004; electric lawn equipment
- &#128078; natural gas boiler for hydronic space heating
- &#128078; natural gas water heater
- &#128078; natural gas decorative fireplace
- &#128078; BBQ propane tank

Not so great, percentage-wise! I didn't really know what to do about
space heating, so I settled for applying to my gas supplier for
["renewable" natural gas](https://www.fortisbc.com/rng/). That felt
better than doing nothing at all, and it approximately doubles our
monthly bill so there's some incentive towards conservation. But paying
to keep natural gas pipes full never really felt like the best outcome,
even if we were helping fill them with captured waste methane rather
than newly extracted natural gas.

Later, I got (very) side-tracked trying to figure out how to get
photovoltaic solar panels installed on our place (uncommon shingle type,
questionable electrical choices made by home builder, ...). For now, I'm
putting that off:

1. BC Hydro is currently [producing 98%](https://www.bchydro.com/toolbar/about/sustainability/our-clean-system.html)
   of its electricity from clean sources. And while there are certainly
   _environmental_ concerns stemming from huge dams, transmission lines,
   land use, etc., I'm probably not going to do better on CO&#8322;e with
   rooftop solar.
2. It rains here in the winter. A lot. So our expected solar yield isn't
   as enticing as California and similar.

However! I'm happy to say that I've gotten back on target and now have
the permits and electrical work done for both an electric heat pump and
an electric water heater.

After plenty of research, I satisfied myself that we didn't need to move
to forced air and add ducting, and could stick with in-floor water
heating. Given that, we chose this [air-to-water heat
pump](https://www.arcticheatpumps.com/). It also advertises the ability
to do some amount of cooling via in-floor hydronic. I'm not optimistic
that it will be very effective because it obviously won't control
humidity, but even a few degrees off the peak temperatures of the next
"heat dome" would be welcome. (Most homes in our area don't have A/C
because as recently as a few years ago it seemed unnecessary.)

The heat pump is backordered for some weeks, but has been ordered, and
should be installed before the next heating season. My very rough
back-of-the-envelope calculation based on:

1. last winter's natural gas consumption
2. estimated efficiency of current boiler
3. conservative estimated efficiency of the heat pump (allegedly
   COP=3.1, but I'm assuming closer to 2.0 in real life)
4. our local hydro kWh price (assuming all [Step 2](https://app.bchydro.com/accounts-billing/rates-energy-use/electricity-rates/residential-rates.html)
   due to EV charging at home)

suggests that it'll be **slightly cheaper to run the heat pump than the
gas boiler**, but only because we're opted-in to 100% RNG. Otherwise,
it'd be roughly a 1.75x factor for electric. But there's a lot of fudge
in those numbers, so for now I'm just looking forward (?) to the sting
of a low-CO&#8322;e Hydro bill, and we'll see what the data says in a year.
