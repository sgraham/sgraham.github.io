title: Replacing input reader in cmd.exe
---

In my [ongoing](/2013/07/04/git-branch-in-cmd/)
[attack](/2013/07/21/suppress-terminate-batch-job/) on cmd.exe, the next thing
I wanted to have was tab-completion of git branch names, since I have
apparently no memory for remembering what the heck I called
_that-other-branch-where-I-was-doing-that-thing_.


Code is at [github](https://github.com/sgraham/cmdEx/).
