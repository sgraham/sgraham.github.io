      The Joystick specification defines a low-level interface that represents
      joystick devices (also known as game pads).
    </section>

    <section id='introduction' class='informative'>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Some <a>user agent</a>s have connected joystick devices (also known
      as gamepads). These devices are desirable and suited to input for gaming
      applications, and for &quot;10 foot&quot; user interfaces
      (presentations, media viewers).</p>

      <p>Currently, the only way for a joystick to be used as input would be
      to emulate mouse or keyboard events, however this would lose information
      and require additional software outside of the <a>user agent</a> to
      accomplish emulation.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, native applications are capable of accessing these devices
      via system APIs.</p>

      <p>The Joystick API provides a solution to this problem by specifying
      interfaces that allow web applications to directly act on joystick
      data.</p>

      <p>This specification references interfaces from a number of other
      specifications:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><a class="externalDFN">Document</a> [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]]</li>
      <li><a class="externalDFN">DOMTimeStamp</a> [[!WEBIDL]]</li>
      <li><a class="externalDFN">WindowAnimationTiming</a> [[ANIMATION-TIMING]]</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="dfn-user-agent">user agent</dfn> that implements
        the interfaces that it contains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]] as
        this specification uses that specification and terminology.
      </p>

      <p>
        A conforming implementation is required to implement all fields
        defined in this specification.

      <h2><a>Joystick</a> Interface</h2>
      <p>
        This interface defines an individual joystick device.
      </p>

      <dl title='interface Joystick' class='idl'>

        <dt>readonly attribute string id</dt>
        <dd>
          An identification string for the joystick.

          This string identifies the brand or style of connected joystick
          device. Typically, this will include the USB vendor and a product
          ID.
        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute long index</dt>
        <dd>
          The index of the joystick in the <a>DocumentJoysticks</a>.

          When multiple joysticks are connected to a <a>user agent</a>,
          indices MUST be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis,
          starting at zero. If a joystick is disconnected, previously assigned
          indices MUST NOT be reassigned to joysticks that continue to be
          connected. However, if a joystick is disconnected, and subsequently
          the same or a different joystick is then connected, index entries
          MUST be reused.

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute DOMTimeStamp timestamp</dt>

        <dd>
          Last time the data for this joystick was updated.

          Timestamp is a monotonically increasing value that allows the author
          to determine if the <code>axes</code> and <code>button</code> data
          have been updated from the hardware, relative to a previously saved
          timestamp.

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute float[] axes</dt>
        <dd>

          Array of values for all axes of the joystick.

          All axis values MUST be linearly normalized to the range [-1.0 ..
          1.0]. As appropriate, -1.0 SHOULD correspond to "up" or "left", and
          1.0 SHOULD correspond to "down" or "right".

          Axes that are drawn from a 2D input device SHOULD appear next to
          each other in the axes array, X then Y.
          
          It is RECOMMENDED that axes appear in decreasing order of
          importance, such that element 0 and 1 typically represent the X and
          Y axis of a directional stick.

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute float[] buttons</dt>
        <dd>
          Array of values for all buttons of the joystick.

          All button values MUST be linearly normalized to the range [0.0 ..
          1.0]. 0.0 MUST mean fully unpressed, and 1.0 MUST mean fully
          pressed.

          It is RECOMMENDED that buttons appear in decreasing importance such
          that the primary button, secondary button, tertiary button, and so
          on appear as elements 0, 1, 2, ... in the buttons array.

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute float[] suggestedAxesDeadZone</dt>
        <dd>

          Array of values that represent suggested amount of input to ignore
          for corresponding values in the axes array. These values are
          hardware dependent and reflect tolerances for sampling (sometimes
          low-quality) analog inputs.

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute float[] suggestedButtonsDeadZone</dt>
        <dd>

          Array of values that represent suggested amount of input to ignore
          for corresponding values in the buttons array. These values are
          hardware dependent and reflect tolerances for sampling (sometimes
          low-quality) analog inputs.

      <h2><a>DocumentJoysticks</a> Interface</h2>

      <p>

        This interface defines a collection of Joysticks. The
        <a>DocumentJoysticks</a> interface MUST be implemented on the
        <a>Document</a> object.

      </p>


      <dl title='interface DocumentJoysticks' class='idl'>
        <dt>readonly attribute Joystick[] joysticks</dt>

        <dd>

          The currently connected and interacted-with joysticks.

          Joysticks MUST only appear in the list if they are currently
          connected to the <a>user agent</a>, and have been interacted with by
          the user. Otherwise, they MUST not appear in the list to avoid a
          malicious page from fingerprinting the user based on connected
          devices.

        </dd>

      </dl>

      <h2><a>JoystickEvent</a> Interface</h2>

      <dl title='interface JoystickEvent' class='idl'>
        <dt>readonly attribute Joystick joystick</dt>

        <dd>

            The single joystick attribute provides access to the associated
            joystick data for this event.

        <h2>Usage Examples</h2>
          
          <p>

            The example below demonstrates typical access to joysticks. Note
            the relationship with the <a>WindowAnimationTiming</a>
            [[!ANIMATION-TIMING]] interface.
          </p>
          
          <section>
              <pre class="example">

function runAnimation()
{
    window.requestAnimationFrame(runAnimation);

    for (var i = 0; i < document.joysticks.length; ++i)
    {
        var joy = document.joysticks[i];
        // todo; simple demo of displaying joy.axes and joy.buttons
    }
}

window.requestAnimationFrame(runAnimation);

              </pre>
          </section>

          <div class="practice"> 
              <p> 
              <span id="practice-timing" class="practicelab">Coordination with
              WindowAnimationTiming</span></p> 
              <p class="practicedesc"> 

              Interactive applications will typically be using the
              <a>WindowAnimationTiming</a> interface to drive animation, and
              will want coordinate animation with user joystick input. As
              such, the joystick data should be polled as closely as possible
              to immediately before the animation callbacks are executed, and
              with frequency matching that of the animation. That is, if the
              animation callbacks are running at 60Hz, the joystick inputs
              should also be sampled at that rate.

      <h3 id="event-joystickconnected">The <dfn class="event">joystickconnected</dfn> event</h3>

        <p>

          A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event type to indicate the
          user has connected a joystick. If a joystick was already connected
          when the page was loaded, the <a>joystickconnected</a> event will be
          dispatched when the user presses a button or moves an axis.

        </p>

    </section>

    <section>

        <h3 id="event-joystickdisconnected">The <dfn class="event">joystickdisconnected</dfn> event</h3>

        <p>

          When a joystick is disconnected from the <a>user agent</a>, if the
          <a>user agent</a> has previously dispatched a
          <a>joystickconnected</a> event, a <a>joystickdisconnected</a> event
          MUST be dispatched.

        </p>

    </section>

    <section>

        <h3>Other events</h3>

        <p>

        <i>More discussion needed, on whether to include or exclude axis and button
        changed events, and whether to roll them more together
        (<code>joystickchanged</code>?), separate somewhat
        (<code>joystickaxischanged</code>?), or separate by individual axis
        and button.</i>
