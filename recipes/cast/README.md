# Description #

A simple dashboard application for Chromecast. Display any web page accessible
by the Chromecast device.

# Benefits #

Unlike tab casting (or screen casting) which requires the sender device to
remain active in order to encode a video+audio feed that is sent to the
Chromecast this approach renders the web page directly on the Chromecast which
has two primary benefits.

1. The sender device can be disconnected from the Chromecast
2. There is no constant network usage required to send video+audio feed

# Usage #
